        <h2> Certified Translations (English&lt;&gt;Spanish) </h2>

        <p>I have been granted a certification by the Spanish Ministry of 
        Foreign Affairs and Cooperation in 2007 which allows me to certify 
        (through my signature and stamp) the accuracy of English and Spanish 
        official documents.</p>
        
        <p>As such, my certified translations are sealed and signed, and are 
        valid before the Public Administrations or private companies 
        in the whole territory of Spain and in English-speaking countries.</p>
        
        <h3> How does it work? </h3>
        
        <p>Certified translations can only be delivered in hardcopy due 
        to their legal nature (they are sealed and signed). 
        Nevertheless, you can send your digitalized documents by 
        e-mail or any other means acceptable in order to start your translation. 
        Once the translation is finished and proofread, you will receive the 
        certified version in person or by courier. </p>
        
        <h3>What types of documents need to be certified?</h3>
        
        <p>Migrating to a new country to find a job, opening a business 
        on European soil or doing business trans-nationally usually requires 
        heavy loads of certified documentation in different languages. 
        If you are a company, you might need a rigorous and effective translation 
        within a very strict time frame.</p>
        
        <p>But also you could be marrying the love of your life and/or have a 
        child abroad, and you both will need to officialise your new situation 
        before the competent authorities.
        Types of documents that generally require certified translations: customs 
        and immigration documents, birth/death certificates, marriage/divorce 
        certificates, academic records, diplomas, academic degrees, real estate 
        deeds, adoption papers, medical records, annual accounts, wills, 
        legal contracts, leases and police records, for example.</p>

        <h2> Translation Services (English/French > Spanish-Catalan)</h2>
        
        <h5>Translation services for the marketing industry:</h5>

        <p>A good translation of marketing materials will help international 
            customers expand their firm with the perfect brochures, 
            case studies, websites, internal documentation, etc.</p>
        
        <h5>Translation services for the medical industry:</h5>
        
        <p>With so much regulation and country-specific rules for the medical, 
            pharma and life sciences industries, medical translators with local 
            language expertise are very important. I am specialised in product 
            information documents, packaging and labelling, informed consents, 
            medical forms and patient documents.</p>
        
        <h5>Translation services for the legal industry:</h5>
        
        Legal translations can be very useful for different purposes: sometimes you need a translation for use in court (divorce settlement abroad, insurance documents after an accident during your holidays, arbitration translations, affidavits, etc.). Whether it is a litigation case or a simple legal disclaimer or license agreement, you will receive the most reliable translation.
        
        <h2> Proofreading services (English/French > Spanish-Catalan)</h2>

        <p>The correctness of a text is the final stage of the editing process. 
        It only starts once the editing phase is complete. 
        It implies checking a translated document against its original document 
        and making sure that you solved all spelling, grammar, syntax, 
        typo and punctuation issues.</p>
        
        <p>Please, feel free to request a quotation here >></p>
        
        <h2>Editing services (Spanish, Catalan) </h2>
        
        <p>s the process of examining a text with the aim of improving 
        the flow and quality of the writing. It is the process of checking and 
        improving the copywriting of a document. This process concentrates 
        less on the form and more on the terminology. 
        Having your best work checked for contextual mistakes and inconsistencies, 
        as well as for quality and accurate terminology, can help you make 
        the difference with respect to your customers.</p>
